# A standard to describe the accessibility of the physical world.

<img alt="A11yJSON icon" src="./images/logo-dark.svg" align="right" width="80" height="80" style="margin-left: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px;" /> A11yJSON is an open standard based on [GeoJSON (RFC 7946)](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7946). Its goal is to make accessibility information more comfortable to exchange.

Integrate A11yJSON into data schemas that describeâ€¦

- real places
- local amenities
- sanitary facilities
- physical media and services
- policies that can be barriers (like dog friendliness)
- escalators and elevators (including their real-time operational status)

This is a valid A11yJSON data snippet:

```json
{
  "entrances": [
    { "name": "30th St", "isMainEntrance": true, "isLevel": false },
    { "name": "Side gate", "hasFixedRamp": true }
  ],
  "animalPolicy": {
    "allowsGuideDogs": false
  }
}
```

See the [examples](1-example-data.md) for more complex definitions, or the [list of accessibility criteria](3-interfaces.md) to see the format's extent.

## Is this for me?

If you build an app that digitalizes any aspect of real life, *you decide if it adds a new barrier to this real world â€“ or creates a new entrance*. Use this power wisely and ensure that your data design is inclusive. ðŸ¦¾

A11yJSON can help you if you work with data inâ€¦

- Architecture
- Indoor navigation
- Facility management
- Accessibility surveys
- Location-based services
- Outdoor/transit navigation
- Building Information Management (BIM)

Here is a [list of projects using A11yJSON](./2-who-uses-a11yjson.md).

## Technicallyâ€¦

A11yJSON provides a collection of [documented interfaces](./3-interfaces.md) for structuring data in your projects â€“ no matter which language you use.

It comes with a TypeScript library to check your data structures at compile-time.

For web and Node.js, there is [`@sozialhelden/a11yjson`, a npm module](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@sozialhelden/a11yjson). The model validates data at runtime using [`SimpleSchema`](https://github.com/aldeed/simple-schema-js),  sanitizes input, and returns sophisticated error messages for wrong data.

The schema definition API is simple to read, so the schema should be portable to other schema languages (GraphQL, JSON Schema, â€¦), if necessary. If you have a specific idea, [letâ€™s talk](mailto:developers@sozialhelden.de)!

## Who is behind A11yJSON?

A11yJSON is made by [Sozialhelden e.V.](https://sozialhelden.de), a non-profit that works on innovative solutions to social issues. Itâ€™s based in Berlin, Germany, and known for [Wheelmap.org](https://wheelmap.org), the worldâ€™s biggest open online map of accessible places.

## Finallyâ€¦

If you think that A11yJSON deserves attention, consider giving it a [Star on GitHub](https://github.com/sozialhelden/a11yjson/), and [sharing it on Twitter](https://twitter.com/share?text=I%20support%20A11yJSON,%20and%20you%20should%20too.%20RT%20to%20spread%20this%20idea!&url=https://a11yjson.org&hashtags=accessibility,a11y,a11yjson,sozialhelden)! ðŸ™Œ
