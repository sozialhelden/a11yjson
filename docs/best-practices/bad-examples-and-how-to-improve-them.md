# Bad examples and how to improve them

## Do’s and Don’ts

The table below displays Do’s and Don’ts of accessibility characterizations.

Bad example|Recommendation
-----|-----
‘The place is not accessible in a wheelchair’| ‘There is one step at the entrance, its height is 2 inches’
‘The place has offers for blind people’| Explain the available facilities, e.g. audio description, tactile ground surfaces, or that a restaurant menu is available in Braille text.
‘The sitemap is accessible for blind people’| ‘The sitemap is available in braille’ or ‘The sitemap has high contrast and uses big fonts’
‘The staff is trained in accomodating people with disabilities’|Explain which facilities or services exist in detail.
‘Wheelchair users gave this place 3/5 stars’|Explain the facilities wheelchair users can find at the place. Is there a step at the entrance? A wheelchair-accessible toilet? Do you need a special key to open the door? If this is too complex, you can offer a traffic light system like Wheelmap.org - but if you do so, the criteria for red/yellow/green must be easy to find in the UI, and the rating must be guided to get consistent data. If you use a traffic light system, use more than colors to differentiate between different levels of accessibility - your color-blind audience will thank you!

## Examples of helpful, measurable data points

- ‘The entrance has an automatic door’
- ‘The entrance has one step with 4cm height
- ‘There is a braille sitemap with raised letters and shapes’
- ‘There are side rails with braille navigation’
- ‘All floors have tactile paving’
- ‘All elevators have speech output, but no braille controls’
- ‘The audition hall has an induction loop’
- ‘The menu has a photo of each dish’
